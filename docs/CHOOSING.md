## Decision Table

| What you want to do | Use this | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Run async tasks in parallel across a multi-thread pool | `EventLoopThreadPool.submit()` / `run_in_pool()` | The only entry point that executes coroutines cross-thread; manage the pool with `async with` |
| Explicitly create a pool object (deferred start / custom options) | `create_pool(num_threads=..., **PoolOptions)` | More controllable than `run_in_pool`; returns a reusable pool |
| Submit a batch of tasks and collect results together | `pool.submit_group()` (with `group.start_soon()`) | Batch dispatch + batch wait; children auto-cancelled on pool close |
| Pin a task to a fixed worker (stateful connection affinity) | `pool.submit(..., pin_to=N)` | Dedicated local queue, deterministic routing |
| Communicate between tasks (Go channel style) | `Channel` | Rust flume lock-free channel, fastest cross-thread |
| Race multiple channels and take the first ready one (Go select) | `select_channel(*channels)` | First ready channel wins |
| Expose only send / only receive halves | `SendChannel` / `ReceiveChannel` (`ch.split()`) | Interface-level misuse prevention |
| Iterate a data stream elegantly (until close) | `Channel` (`async for item in ch:`) | Iteration protocol + auto termination on close |
| Just want a ready-made channel (asyncssh zero-config) | `Channel()` | Direct construction, no pool needed |
| Mutually exclusive access to a shared resource | `Lock` | Fair FIFO, safe across loops/threads |
| Limit concurrency (N permits) | `Semaphore` | Fixed permit pool, FIFO waiting |
| Dynamically resize the concurrency cap | `CapacityLimiter` | `total_tokens` resizable at runtime |
| One-shot broadcast "state has happened" | `Event` | Sticky (trio semantics), never cleared after set |
| Wait for a condition (paired with a lock) | `Condition` | `wait()` releases the lock; `notify()` needs no lock |
| N tasks wait for each other (round sync) | `Barrier` | Auto-resets each round, reusable |
| Wait until a group of tasks all finish | `AsyncWaitGroup` | Go `sync.WaitGroup` semantics, cross-thread |
| Run exactly-once initialization (singleton) | `AsyncOnce` | Concurrency-safe, runs once, shares result |
| Read-mostly shared state | `AsyncRWMutex` | `async with rw.reader():` parallel readers, `async with rw.writer():` exclusive |
| Structured concurrency: children always reaped | `TaskGroup` (`tg.start_soon()` + `TaskHandle`) | All children guaranteed finished when leaving the scope |
| Overall deadline, raise on timeout | `fail_after(sec)` / `fail_at(deadline)` | Raises `TimeoutError` on expiry |
| Overall deadline, exit silently on timeout | `move_on_after(sec)` / `move_on_at(deadline)` | Exits silently; check `scope.cancelled_caught` |
| Fine-grained cancellation (manual / shielded) | `CancelScope(deadline=..., shield=...)` | Manual `scope.cancel()`; shield blocks parent cancellation |
| Periodically check cancellation in a long loop | `checkpoint()` | Cancellation checkpoint inside sync code |
| Query the tightest effective deadline | `current_effective_deadline()` | Shield truncates outer deadlines |
| Cross-thread cascading cancellation / timeout broadcast | `AsyncContext` | Tree-propagated cancellation |
| Logging / adjust log level | `get_logger()` / `set_log_level()` | Unified logging outlet |

## Primitive Quick Reference (one line each)

- **`EventLoopThreadPool`** — a pool = N isolated asyncio loops; `submit` goes
  through a global lock-free queue with work stealing; the `pin_to=` argument
  uses a dedicated local queue. The pool is an **async context manager**:
  `async with EventLoopThreadPool(num_threads=4) as pool:`.
- **`Channel`** — data plane in Rust (flume), wait plane in Python
  (double-check lock). Bounded (`maxsize=N`) or unbounded (default). Safe to
  send/recv cross-thread.
- **`select_channel`** — one reader per channel; the first to deliver wins
  and the other readers are cancelled; supports `timeout=` and `default=`
  (non-blocking poll mode).
- **`AsyncWaitGroup`** — `add()` counts, `done()` decrements, `wait()` blocks
  until zero. **Rule: all `add()` calls must happen-before `wait()`** (Go
  same).
- **`AsyncOnce`** — the first caller is the leader and executes; followers
  await the result; exceptions are cached and re-raised to every follower.
- **`TaskGroup`** — exits `async with` only after all children finish; a
  failing child cancels the rest and failures aggregate into
  `BaseExceptionGroup`.
- **`CancelScope`** — one scope stack per task; `shield=True` keeps parent
  cancellation out (usable by cleanup code); `fail_after`/`move_on_after`
  are convenience wrappers.
- **`Lock`/`Semaphore`/`Event`/`Condition`/`Barrier`** — Go + trio semantics:
  FIFO fairness, cross-loop/thread safety, cancellation-safe. `Event` has no
  `clear()`.
- **`AsyncContext`** — a global cascading cancellation tree: when a context's
  tasks/channels are cancelled, the whole subtree is cancelled together.
- **`AsyncRWMutex`** — `async with rw.reader():` shared read,
  `async with rw.writer():` exclusive write; see [API.md](API.md) for the
  corresponding entry.
- **Exceptions** — `ChannelClosedError` (channel closed),
  `ThreadPoolClosedError` (pool closed), `TimeoutError` (multiloop's own
  timeout, not the builtin), `WouldBlock` (non-blocking op has no data),
  base class `MultiloopError`.

## Minimal Quick-Start Code

```python
import asyncio
import multiloop


async def main():
    # Pool: submit + await result
    async with multiloop.EventLoopThreadPool(num_threads=4) as pool:
        fut = pool.submit(asyncio.sleep, 0.01)
        await fut

    # Channel: cross-task communication
    ch = multiloop.Channel()
    await ch.send(42)
    print(await ch.recv())  # 42

    # Wait for a group
    wg = multiloop.AsyncWaitGroup()
    wg.add(1)
    wg.done()
    await wg.wait()


asyncio.run(main())
```

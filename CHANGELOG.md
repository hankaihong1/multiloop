## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-17

### Added & Optimized
- **Cross-Loop Structured Concurrency (`TaskGroup` & `AsyncContext`)**:
  - `TaskGroup(pool=...)` multi-loop task distribution with isolated per-task child `CancelScope` instances.
  - Remote drain barrier on context exit, bidirectional cascading cancellation, and unified `ExceptionGroup` aggregation.
  - Unified `AsyncContext.task_group(pool=...)` lifecycle tracking and automatic cascading cancellation.
- **Native Synchronous Channel Communication (`Channel.send_sync` & `Channel.recv_sync`)**:
  - Replaced busy-spin polling with native `parking_lot::Condvar` wait/notify in `RawAsyncChannel`.
  - Releases the Python GIL via `py.detach()` during blocking waits, eliminating CPU waste.
  - Added `ReceiveChannel.recv_sync(timeout=None)` to segregation views.
- **Concurrency & Free-Threaded (Python 3.14t) Hardening**:
  - `AsyncRWMutex`: Protected reentrancy depth and writer task with `self._depth_lock = threading.Lock()`, with out-of-lock `_wake_all()` execution to eliminate deadlocks.
  - `EventLoopThreadPool`: Implemented condition-variable drain barrier `self._drain_barrier` and event-driven worker dispatcher.
  - `AtomicMetrics`: Added `add_global_pull` batch counter accumulation and upgraded pool metrics to `RwLock`.
  - `_channel_base.py`: Enforced $O(1)$ waiter unregistration via `OrderedDict.pop()`.
  - `AsyncWaitGroup`: Removed GC finalizer `self._wg.done()` invocation in `_TrackedCoroutine.__del__` to prevent cross-thread re-entrancy and deadlocks under multi-threaded GC.
  - Standardized cross-language `ThreadPoolClosedError` exception hierarchy.

- **Rust SIMD HTTP Sliced Streaming & Zero-Allocation Fast-Path (`src/http.rs`, `src/multiloop/_http11.py`)**:
  - `FastHttpConnection` streaming body sliced event dispatch (`ReceivingContentLength`) eliminating cursor rewind and $O(N^2)$ header re-parsing on split TCP packets.
  - $O(1)$ buffer compaction via `compact_buffer` clearing on cursor drain without memory copies.
  - Fast-path for zero-body GET/HEAD requests with module-level singleton `_EMPTY_BODY_MSG`, completely eliminating `asyncio.Queue` heap allocation and event loop dispatch overhead.
- **ASGI Transport Backpressure & Pipelining Concurrency Protection (`src/multiloop/_http11.py`, `src/multiloop/_websocket.py`)**:
  - Physical write backpressure flow control (`_drain_event`) in `Http11Protocol.send()` eliminating server OOM under slow clients.

  - RFC 6455 WebSocket thread-safe send frame lock synchronization (`_send_lock`), eliminating `RuntimeError: concurrent drain calls` on high-concurrency data/control frame writes.
- **WSGI True Streaming Channel & Client Disconnect Decoupling (`src/multiloop/wsgi.py`)**:
  - `SyncStreamReader` backed by lock-free cross-thread `Channel(maxsize=16)`, eliminating the 10MB pre-buffering requirement and enabling true streaming request body consumption.
  - Automatic channel closure and feeder cancellation upon client disconnection, preventing orphaned synchronous WSGI worker tasks from occupying the thread pool.
- **No-GIL Task Collection Thread Safety & Adaptive CLI Watcher (`src/multiloop/server.py`, `src/multiloop/cli.py`)**:
  - `ConnectionPinningServer` multi-worker task collection mutex protection (`_tasks_lock`), eliminating `RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration` during `server.close()` under Python 3.14t physical multi-core execution.
  - CLI file watcher with extended ignored directories and adaptive smooth polling backoff (0.3s~0.8s), reducing idle CPU usage while maintaining fast hot-reload responsiveness.
